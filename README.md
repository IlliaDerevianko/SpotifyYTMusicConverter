Script that automatically converts your Spotify playlist to a YouTube Music playlist

This program is not intended to be used on a large scale. This is just a demonstration of how to automate dull tasks using API.

Motivation: people use different music streaming platforms and it is difficult for them to share playlists they love.
  Therefore, it would be great to automate the process of adding tracks from a playlist on one service to a playlist on a different one.

Description: This script utilises Spotify and YouTube APIs to convert a Spotify playlist to a YouTube music playlist.
I use the simplest form of authentication to avoid app authorization to access Google API which has a small quota of requests per day.
The program allows the user to choose one of their Spotify playlists and get the same playlist on YouTube music with minimal effort within a matter of minutes.

Results: the program creates new playlists with high accuracy, ultimately reaching the aim of the project.

Limitations: due to the quota from Google, the size of the playlist is limited to around 30 tracks.
